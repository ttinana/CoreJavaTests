		 * string. So what's wrong with this?
		 * 
		 * In case If you have still not figured it out, If the original string
		 * is very long, and has array of size 1GB, no matter how small a
		 * substring is, it will hold 1GB array. This will also stop original
		 * string to be garbage collected, in case if doesn't have any live
		 * reference. This is clear case of memory leak in Java, where memory is
		 * retained even if it's not required. That's how substring method
		 * creates memory leak.
