 *         Multiple inheritance of implementation is the ability to inherit
 *         method definitions from multiple classes. Problems arise with this
 *         type of multiple inheritance, such as name conflicts and ambiguity.
 *         When compilers of programming languages that support this type of
 *         multiple inheritance encounter superclasses that contain methods with
 *         the same name, they sometimes cannot determine which member or method
 *         to access or invoke. In addition, a programmer can unwittingly
 *         introduce a name conflict by adding a new method to a superclass.
 *         Default methods introduce one form of multiple inheritance of
 *         implementation. A class can implement more than one interface, which
 *         can contain default methods that have the same name. The Java
 *         compiler provides some rules to determine which default method a
 *         particular class uses.
